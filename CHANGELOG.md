## 2.10.1 (2023-7-24)

* Added `auto_resolve_after` parameter in `Detect` class.

## 2.10.0 (2023-7-19)

* Added `AmazonEventBridgeNotification` for Amazon EventBridge integration within detectors.
* Added combinators `EQ` (Equal) and `NE` (Not Equal).

## 2.9.3 (2020-3-18)

* Added `Alerts` in `signal_analog.flow` module to allow linking Detectors to Charts. 

## 2.9.2 (2019-11-11)

* `StrArg` will only reject `None` instead of all falsey values, allowing `0` to be given as a value.

## 2.9.1 (2019-10-30)

* Resources have learned that deleting nothing results in nothing, and will
stop complaining about this scenario (it will still register it's displeasure
in a debug log message)

## 2.9.0 (2019-09-26)

* Added `BigPandaNotification` for BigPanda integration within detectors.

## 2.8.0 (2019-09-06)

* Added `groupBy` support to the chart options. Allows grouping for example of HeatMap charts into groups on multiple levels.
* Added support for `colorScale2` option on HeatMap charts. This allows to set custom chart colors for a defined range of values.

## 2.7.2 (2019-05-14)

### Fixed

  - `signal_analog` has learned to use the `groupId` field when updating
  Dashboard resources after the recent Sfx API changes

### Updated

  - As many documentation links as possible since the last doc update from Sfx.
  Notable missing updates are those for 3rd party integration Notifications in
  the `signal_analog.detectors` module.

## 2.7.0 (2019-04-03)

### Updated
  * Removed dashboard numbering for two reasons:
    1. There was a bug in the logic that caused dashboards to be deleted and recreated on update.
    1. The functionality is no longer needed as SignalFx automatically maintains the order that dashboards were provided and allows easy reordering in the UI.
  * AxisOptions are now optional where used

### Fixed

* Fixing applyIfExists option for Dashboard variables.

## 2.6.0 (2019-03-21)

  * AxisOption parameters should be optional.
  * Additional documentation.

## 2.5.0 (2019-03-20)

  * Added `Plot` class, a helper class that gives an interface more like that found in the SignalFx UI.
  * Added `RollupType` enum for specifying the roll-up used in Charts.
  * Added additional documentation links to README.
  * Fix: TextCharts weren't working
  * Fix: YAML load deprecation warning in logging config

## 2.4.0

  * Add numbering to dashboards in a dashboard group for better organization 
  of dashboards

## 2.3.2 (2018-11-12)

  * The `percentile` function on `signal_analog.flow.Data` objects has been
  fixed to use the correct constructor

## 2.3.1 (2018-11-06)

  * signal-analog now prefers `simplejson` if it is available on the path,
  falling back to the `json` module otherwise.

## 2.3.0 (2018-10-30)

  * DashboardGroup has learned how to accept SignalFX Team ids so that they can
  be associated with pre-existing teams via the `with_teams` builder method.

## 2.2.2 (2018-10-03)

### Fixed
  * Add `deprecation` to setup.py.

## 2.2.1 (2018-10-02)

### Changed
  * Added `with_secondary_visualization` function to enable display of various meters (Sparkline, Linear, Radial) in 
  Single Value charts. This replaces the now defunct `with_sparkline_hidden` function. This will not be a 
  'breaking change' until version 3.0.0 when `with_sparkline_hidden` will be removed from `signal_analog`.

  * Added the `deprecation` Python library to this project to note when `with_sparkline_hidden` should be removed. Upon 
  version matching 3.0.0 or higher the tests for that function will begin to fail notifying whoever is releasing that 
  version to remove the defunct `with_sparkline_hidden` function and tests.

## 2.2.0 (2018-09-27)

### Changed
  * Dashboard Create method to accept group id of an existing dashboard group in which case the new dashboard will be
   part of the dashboard group provided

   Example:
```python
response = dashboard\
  .with_charts(memory_chart)\
  .with_api_token('my-api-token')\
  .create(group_id="asdf;lkj")
```
  * Dashboard Group create method to pass group id of the newly created dashboard group to the dashboard create 
  method so that we can avoid  a few redundant calls like cloning and deleting the dashboards

## 2.1.0 (2018-08-21)

### Added

  * ListCharts learned how to filter legend options via the
  `with_legend_options` builder
  * Future chart types that can filter legend options may now take advantage
  of the `signal_analog.charts.LegendOptionsMixin` class
  * The `FieldOption` class has learned to accept `SignalFxFieldOption`s which
  provide mappings between field options seen in the UI and those used in the
  API
      * e.g. `Plot Name` in the UI and `sf_originatingMetric` in the API
  * A new `TextChart` object has been added to `signal_analog.charts` that
  enables text descriptions to be added to dashboards.
  * `PublishLabelOptions` has learned to accept prefix, suffix, and unit
  arguments when labelling data on charts.

### Changed

  * `PublishLabelOptions` has learned to accept all arguments as optional
  with the exception of the `label` argument.

### Fixed

  * A fix has been added for Python 2 users that prevented successful
  dashboard updates.

## 2.0.0 (2018-07-24)

For assistance migrating from 1.x to 2.x please consult the
[migration guide][migration-1x].

### Added

  * Add support for the `dimensions`, `fill`, `integrate`, `kpss`,
  `rateofchange` methods


### Removed

  * `map` method support has been removed
      * It didn't work properly to begin with, and will require some finagling
      to get right given our approach to building SignalFlow statements

### Fixes

  * `top` and `bottom` method signatures have been fixed to use `count`, `by`,
  and `percentage` arguments
  * The following functions have been updated to raise an error if both
  `by` and `over` are defined in the same method call:
      * `count`, `max`, `mean`, `mean_plus_stddev`, `median`, `min`,
      `percentile`, `random`, `size`, `stddev`, `sum`, `variance`
  * `delta` has been updated to no longer accept any method arguments
  * `ewma` has been updated to support the `over` key

## 1.6.0 (2018-07-18)

  * Add combinators for less-than-or-equal-to (`LTE`) and greater-than-or-equal-to (`GTE`)

  * Added a Ref flow operator that will enable referencing assignments in a way that can be validated at later steps by checking for an Assign object with a match between the reference string and the assignee

## 1.1.0 (2018-04-04)
  * Introducing Dashboard Filters(only variables as of now) which can be configured to provide various filters that affect the behavior of all configured charts (overriding any conflicting filters at the chart level). You may wish to do this in order to quickly change the environment that you're observing for a given set of charts.

## 1.0.0 (2018-04-02)

  * Symbolic release for `signal_analog`. Future version bumps should conform
  to the `semver` policy outlined [here][deployment].

    will hide that particular stream in a chart/detector.

## 0.21.0 (2018-02-28)

  * Dashboard Group support has been added giving you the ability group sets of
  dashboards together in a convenient construct
  * Detector support has been added giving you the ability to create detectors
  from scratch or re-use the SignalFlow program of an existing Chart
  * Dashboards and Charts now update via their `id` instead of by name to
  mitigate name conflicts when creating multiple resources with the same name
  * Dry-run results are now more consistent between all resources and expose
  the API call (sans-headers) that would have been made to use for the given
  resource

## 0.20.0 (2018-01-31)

  * Dashboards have learned how to update their child resources (e.g. if you
    add a chart in your config, the change will be reflected when you next run
    your configuration against SignalFx)
  * The CLI builder has learned how to pass dry-run options to its configured resources
  * Minor bugfixes for the `signal_analog.flow` module
