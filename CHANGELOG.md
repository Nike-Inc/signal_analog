  * Symbolic release for `signal_analog`. Future version bumps should conform
  to the `semver` policy outlined [here][deployment].

## 0.25.1 (2018-03-22)

  * The timeshift method's arguments changed. Now accepts a single argument for offset.

  to create SignalFlow Functions

## 0.22.0 (2018-03-01)

    will hide that particular stream in a chart/detector.

## 0.21.0 (2018-02-28)

  * Dashboard Group support has been added giving you the ability group sets of
  dashboards together in a convenient construct
  * Detector support has been added giving you the ability to create detectors
  from scratch or re-use the SignalFlow program of an existing Chart
  * Dashboards and Charts now update via their `id` instead of by name to
  mitigate name conflicts when creating multiple resources with the same name
  * Dry-run results are now more consistent between all resources and expose
  the API call (sans-headers) that would have been made to use for the given
  resource

## 0.20.0 (2018-01-31)

  * Dashboards have learned how to update their child resources (e.g. if you
    add a chart in your config, the change will be reflected when you next run
    your configuration against SignalFx)
  * The CLI builder has learned how to pass dry-run options to its configured resources
  * Minor bugfixes for the `signal_analog.flow` module

  * Added click to setup.py

## 0.19.0 (2018-01-19)

  * Added CLI builder to create and update dashboard resources

## 0.18.0 (2018-01-11)

  * Dashboard resources have learned to interactively prompt the user if the user wants to

## 0.12.0 (2017-12-21)

  * Dashboard resources have learned how to check for themselves in the
  SignalFx API, and will no longer create themselves if an exact match is found

  abstractions in future versions.
